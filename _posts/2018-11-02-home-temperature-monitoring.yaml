# Part 1. Abstract
The main idea is to build a system to monitor temperature and humidity in my house and have access from a phone, tablet, laptop, etc. Additionally, I want to have historical data and show temperature, and humidity charts for the last 24 hours, month, and year, for instance.

To build the monitoring system I'm going to use [Arduino Pro Mini](https://amzn.to/2SriJVC) as the main device which will read data from [DHT22](https://amzn.to/2Jnt5lg) temperature/humidity sensor and send them by [Digi ZigBee Series 1](https://amzn.to/2Jnuet4). As a receiving device, I will use Raspberry PI 3 with connected [Digi ZigBee Series 1](https://amzn.to/2Jnuet4) but configured as the receiver.

All code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fisenkodv/home-temperature-monitoring), feel free to fork and use the code.

Let's get started.
